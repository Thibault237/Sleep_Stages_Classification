Sleep stages classification projects.

The goal is to build a classifier for 30seconds electroencephalogram, head attached accelerometers and pulse-meter samples which we want
to classify as one of the sleep stages (Awake, Rapid Eye Movement, N1, N2, N3).

A labeled Dataset of about 40000 anotated samples is used for this purpose
